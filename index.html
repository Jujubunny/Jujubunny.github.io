      <p style="text-align:center;font-family:'Helvetica Neue'">My business used Judy Freeman to plan and execute our conferences and trade shows. When we hired her, we were looking for a meeting planner. What we got was a wonderful businesswoman who rolled her sleeves up and helped us meet our goals in every way possible. From pre-planning through the end of the conference, Judy took charge. Always the first onsite and the last to leave, negotiating the best contracts, and helping out in every way possible - even when it wasn’t part of our agreement. She became an essential part of our team. There is no better person to trust with your meeting, events, or in her new venture “Boxed with a Twist”!
